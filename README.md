**what is Open Binary ?**<br/>
Open Binary has a simple code to add and subtract binary numbers

### Features
:heavy_check_mark: Adding a binary number to another binary number<br/>
:heavy_check_mark: Subtracting binary numbers from other numbers

***

## HOW TO USE
just download this code and place it in workspace

### Simple Use
import OpenBinary
```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import  OpenBinary
```
>**Create New Binary**
>```python
>binary = OpenBinary.Biner('1010')
>print(binary, chr(binary))
>```
>**The result should be**
>```
>1010	c
>```
>***
>>**1. Sum**
>>```python
>>binary = binary.sumWith("1001")
>>print(binary, chr(binary))
>>```
>>**The result should be**
>>```
>>10011	âœ›
>>```
>
>>**2. Subtract**
>>```python
>>binary = binary.subWith("1001")
>>print(binary, chr(binary))
>>```
>>**The result should be**
>>```
>>1010	c
>>```
